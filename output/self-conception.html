Everyone who feels at home under this umbrella, meaning everyone who doesn’t identify as cis male, is invited.</p><p>When? August 15th – 18th 2019<br>Where? Northern Brandenburg, aproximately 100 km outside of Berlin. There will be a shuttle to and from the nearest train station<br>Who? 150-200 FLINT*s<br>Money? Solidarity in finances: everyone who wants to come, will get the chance, regardless of their financial status. The amount that covers our expenses would be between 30-50 €</p><p><strong>What is this about?</strong></p><p>We invite you to create a FLINT* space with us in Northern Brandenburg from August 15th -18th! Together with you we’d like to share skills, discuss, network but also just relax, go for swims or walks and hang out. ‘Cause it can also just be a vacation sometimes!<br>We want to make space for all different kinds of topics and struggles that move us: queer_feminism, anti-racism, climate-justice, anti-capitalism, anti-repression, action trainings, …, because FLINT* is more than feminism!<br>We want to open up possibilities to do what you’ve always wanted to try: chainsaws, debates, coding, boxing…!</p><p>You have a skill you’d like to share with other FLINT*s or you want to learn something that’s important for your political practice, your lived reality and well-being as a FLINT* person? Than lead a workshop, invite friends, or just tag along, your experiences are an important source of knowledge!<br>Our camp is for FLINT* folks with an interest in leftist politics. If you’re an organizer in a leftist group, cook in a community d.i.y. kitchen, do union work, are part of a critical art/culture project or fight for a sustainable and radical change in society in any other way, please join us! Are you taking a break from it all at the moment, because being an activist and a parent is hard or your job is too draining, or, or, or, …? And you think: cool idea, but I have no time or resources for political stuff? Then we’d like to invite you especially! We want this camp to be an opportunity to recharge our batteries and go back to our daily lives and_or political work refreshed.</p><p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p>We are a loose network of FLINT* folks, who have come together as a group to organize this camp and hold their meetings in Berlin. We come from different groups, have different backgrounds and practices, some of us organized in FLINT* only groups, some of us with cis-guys. We are far from having all the answers or finished discussions, but we want to give it a try: what brings us together is the desire to create a space that we lack in our daily lives, for a space we wish could exist for all.<br>At the moment, we are more homogeneous than we’d like to be. We try to be as aware and critical of structural power dynamics as possible. We work to prevent exclusions</p><p><strong>Organizing the camp:</strong></p><p>This is our first time organizing a camp like this. We see our part as providing an infrastructure to facilitate your knowledge, skills and wishes. We are pragmatic and unprofessional: let’s meet at eye-level and organize as much as possible together at the camp. We do not want this to be a congress to which we invite experts who visit for 2h charging tons of money and then leave us just listening and feeling small. We want this to be an exchange and exploration of ideas and experiences among equals. We are about sharing, empowerment, solidarity and fun!</p><p><strong>Awareness and “house rules”</strong></p><p>To make sure that everyone can be comfortable, it’s important to take care of each other, be attentive and able to take criticism.<br>FLINT* spaces feel “safer” to a lot of us, but that doesn’t mean those space are actually “safe”. We work to make everybody feel comfortable and not to reproduce structural inequalities.</p><p>We will provide:<br>- child care<br>- quiet spaces to retreat to<br>- an awareness team<br>- camp safety<br>- accessibility: the perimeter is mostly flat, but the paths arent paved. We will work out wheelchair accessible toilets etc.<br>- translations if necessary</p><p>→ if you have any particular requests or needs, please let us know so we can accommodate them.</p><p>Does this sound fun to you? Do you want to join us in organizing, facilitate a workshop, or just come by in August?<br>Then get in touch, we are excited about fellow campers!</p><p>If you’d like to lead a workshop, write us: flint-camp@systemli.org<br>if you’d like to register as a participant: <a href="https://flint.reizschelle.de/">https://flint.reizschelle.de</a></p></div><footer class="u-innerwrap"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 22, 2019</p><div class="post__bio"><h3 class="u-h5"><a href="https://flint-camp.github.io/FLINT-Camp/authors/flintcamp/" class="inverse" title="FLINT*Camp">FLINT*Camp</a></h3></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://flint-camp.github.io/FLINT-Camp/turkce.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="post__nav__text">Next Post<h5>türkce</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://flint-camp.github.io/FLINT-Camp/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=f307ecc7f6353949f03c06ffa70652a2"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://flint-camp.github.io/FLINT-Camp/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=3b94d4998f24c4cebb952de3a9b15b22"></script></body></html>
